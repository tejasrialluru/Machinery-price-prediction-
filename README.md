# flight-fare-prediction-
Abstract of the project: 

Apply different regression models on the kaggle - flight fare prediction dataset and 
compare their R2 scores to determine the best performing model. 

Project Description: 

Three Regression models, Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Random Forest were applied on the kaggle data set of Flight fare prediction after the required data preprocessing. 
The corresponding R2 scores are :
Linear Regression = 0.6195,
Polynomial Regression = 0.7353,
Random Forest = 0.7972. 
From this, Random Forest model was concluded as the relatively best perfoming model.
